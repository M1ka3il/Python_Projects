# Benzinsraper (Last change: 18.07.2022)
A script that gives me the information about gas stations (adreses, price, distance ... ) in a radius of 15km. 

The scraping works, but I'm thinking about applying some changes so the output becomes cleaner. 

Yet some open To-Do's in this project:
1. Find a way to clean up the output-strings.
2. output should be wprinted into an excelsheet
